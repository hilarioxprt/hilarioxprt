# hilarioxprt — Data Engineering & Analytics

I build reliable, scalable data solutions that turn complex data into clear business value. My work spans data modeling, analytics, big-data engineering, cloud deployment and software development — combining technical rigor with a practical, outcome-focused approach.

## 1. About me

I am specializing in designing and building data systems that support reporting, advanced analytics and production-grade data workflows. My knowledge and skills are applicable in addressing different real-world problems related to modelling and securing data, implementing distributed processing and machine-learning pipelines, cloud solutions, and delivering solutions that drive measurable business outcomes.

## 2. Skills and knowledge

### Data modelling & analytics
- Strong SQL and database programming: Oracle SQL*Plus and PL/SQL for relational systems; practical experience with MongoDB for NoSQL scenarios.  
- Design, model, develop, and manipulate databases; write transactions, stored procedures, and business-rule logic to ensure data integrity and security.    
- Use data for business reporting, exploratory analysis, and advanced analytics; work with non-traditional data types and systems.  
- Knowledgeable about the professional, legal, security, and ethical responsibilities of database designers.

### Big data & cloud computing
- Solve realistic large-scale problems (fraud detection, churn analysis, medical diagnosis and others) using machine learning and statistical approaches at scale.  
- Hands-on with Apache Spark, Python 3, Pandas, and Jupyter Notebooks for data processing, modelling and experimentation.  
- Experience hosting multi‑terabyte datasets on cloud providers and working with distributed processing environments (Hadoop, Spark clusters).  
- Apply supervised and unsupervised methods, statistical modelling, and 2D/3D visualisations to generate and communicate insights.

### Statistical analysis & Business Intelligence
- Apply analytical techniques across the full lifecycle: data processing, exploratory analysis, probability and distributions, hypothesis testing, correlation and regression, classification, distance measures and clustering.  
- Translate statistical results into actionable business recommendations and BI artefacts for stakeholders.

### Object-oriented programming & software development
- Solid OOP foundations: data types, classes, objects, inheritance, interfaces, polymorphism and methods.  
- Design, implement, test and document programs with strong attention to coding standards and quality principles.  
- Experience with GUI programming and common development tools (compilers, IDEs) to build maintainable software.
